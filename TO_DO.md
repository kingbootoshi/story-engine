1. ensure that the world module works perfectly w trpc and our frontend
2. create the locations module
3. create the factions module
4. create the characters module 
    q: are players also characters?
    a: i think players are also characters. we should put them under the same
    category because characters should be able to have dialog with eachother.
    just like players can have dialog with characters.
    characters should be able to do actions
    just like players can also do actions
    to shape the game narrative


probably important to do in the future:
- ensure proper error handling and fallback for AI core and ALL AI calls

modules to do:
worlds
- make it so arcs have a detailed description explaining the whole point of the arc
- ensure that progerssing beats contains the context of this description
