# modules to do:

## worlds
- ensure that world beat is the only event that locations/factions/characters react to
- every single module should only react to world.beat event, nothing else
- each entity in location, each faction, and each character have their own individual AI that
reacts indepdently based on the world beat. default "no change" and change

(that ensures that the golden rule stays simple and complexity doesn't happen dev side)

## locations

## factions

## characters

## misc
- i want to have a world map that gets created especially since we provide the x/y coordinates of locations
