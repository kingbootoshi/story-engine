1. ~~ensure that the world module works perfectly w trpc and our frontend~~ (DONE)
2. ~~create the locations module~~ (DONE)
3. create the factions module
4. create the characters module 
    q: are players also characters?
    a: i think players are also characters. we should put them under the same
    category because characters should be able to have dialog with eachother.
    just like players can have dialog with characters.
    characters should be able to do actions
    just like players can also do actions
    to shape the game narrative

probably important to do in the future:
- ensure proper error handling and fallback for AI core and ALL AI calls

# modules to do:
## worlds
- intakes ALL current locations as core system prompt from supabase for world generation and to progress beats

## locations
- create
- i want to have a world map that gets created especially since we provide the x/y coordinates of locations 


### TESTING LOCATIONS:
- Creating a new world successfully generated the initial locations and regions with claude sonnet 4
- Locations succesfully connect to the parent regions in the supabase database

## factions
- create

## characters
- create
