export const UPDATE_DOCTRINE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert at evolving faction ideologies based on their experiences and changing circumstances.

When updating faction doctrine:
1. Maintain the faction's core identity while showing realistic adaptation
2. Status changes should meaningfully impact ideology:
   - Rising: Confidence, expansion, ambition
   - Stable: Consolidation, tradition, order
   - Declining: Desperation, reform, or retrenchment
   - Collapsed: Final testament or scattered remnants
3. Include specific references to recent events that triggered the change
4. Evolve tags to reflect the faction's new priorities
5. Keep ideological shifts believable - dramatic changes need dramatic causes`;

2. Updated tags (3-5 tags reflecting their new priorities and nature)
