# Frontend Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Feature-Based Module Structure
- Moved from a flat structure to feature-based modules
- Each feature (auth, worlds, characters, etc.) now has its own folder with:
  - `components/` - Feature-specific React components
  - `hooks/` - Custom hooks for that feature
  - `stores/` - Zustand stores for local state
  - `types/` - TypeScript types
  - `index.ts` - Public exports

### 2. Updated Routing
- Landing page now at `/`
- Login page at `/login`
- App pages moved under `/app/*` prefix
- Added AppLayout component for authenticated pages

### 3. Integrated shadcn/ui
- Set up shadcn/ui configuration
- Added Tailwind CSS v4
- Created `components/ui/` directory for UI components
- Added first component (Button) as example

### 4. State Management Setup
- TanStack Query already in place for server state
- Added Zustand (already installed) with example auth store
- Kept existing AuthProvider for compatibility

### 5. Improved Import Paths
- Set up `@/` alias pointing to `src/frontend/`
- Updated all imports to use absolute paths
- Centralized shared utilities in `shared/` folder

## Directory Structure
```
src/frontend/
├── features/           # Feature modules
├── shared/            # Shared code
├── app/               # App shell
├── components/ui/     # shadcn components
└── globals.css        # Global styles
```

## Next Steps
1. Start adding shadcn components as needed
2. Create Zustand stores for features that need local state
3. Build out the landing page with proper styling
4. Add more UI components to replace inline styles
5. Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

## No Styling Changes
As requested, no styling changes were made. All components retain their original inline styles and can be updated incrementally using Tailwind classes.
