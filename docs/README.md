## What is World Story Engine?

The World Story Engine is a narrative generation system that:
- Creates evolving story arcs for entire game worlds
- Responds dynamically to player actions and events
- Uses AI to generate contextual story beats
- Maintains narrative continuity across multiple arcs
- Provides structured data for game integration

## Core Concepts

- **World Arcs**: 15-beat narrative structures that define major world transformations
- **Anchor Points**: Three key story moments (beginning, middle, end) that guide the narrative
- **Dynamic Beats**: AI-generated story moments that adapt to player actions
- **World Events**: Player actions and system events that influence the narrative
- **Narrative Continuity**: Each arc builds on previous world history
