## Character Evolution Summary

### Elena's Journey
1. Started: Compassionate healer at temple
2. Beat 1: Rushed to help → gained active role
3. Beat 2: Falsely accused → motivated by injustice
4. Beat 3: Learned truth → pivoted to curse-breaking

### The Wanderer's Role
1. Started: Mysterious wildcard
2. Beat 1: Witnessed plague → became investigator
3. Beat 3: Discovered truth → became key to solution

### Faction Dynamics Through Characters
- Healers: United through shared persecution
- Merchants: Some doubt their leaders' accusations
- City Watch: Torn between duty and truth

## Memory Importance Examples

### High Importance (0.9-1.0)
- "Discovered ancient curse is real cause" (Wanderer)
- "Falsely accused of spreading plague" (Elena)
- "Watched Doctor Aldric die" (witnesses)

### Medium Importance (0.5-0.8)

- "Business suffering from plague fears" (merchants)

### Low Importance (0.3-0.4)

- "Patrol routes changed due to quarantine" (guards)

## Emergent Stories

These character reactions created unexpected narratives:

1. **Brother Marcus's Crisis of Faith**: Considering leaving the Healers after accusations
2. **Street Orphans Organize**: Background characters step up during crisis
3. **Merchant Guilt**: Some merchants secretly fund healing efforts
4. **The Seer's Prophecy**: Martha's warnings gain new relevance

## Key Takeaways

1. **Individual Reactions Matter**: Each character's response shapes the narrative
2. **Memories Drive Change**: Important events leave lasting impacts
3. **Roles Guide Participation**: Major characters react broadly, background narrowly
4. **Emergence Is Key**: Unexpected character actions create rich stories
5. **Death Has Impact**: Doctor Aldric's death affects multiple characters

This workflow demonstrates how the character module transforms abstract beats into personal, human stories that players can connect with emotionally.
