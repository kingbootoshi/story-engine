# Character Module System Overview

The Character module provides the living, breathing inhabitants of the Story Engine worlds. Characters are dynamic entities that evolve, form relationships, and react to the unfolding narrative, creating emergent storytelling opportunities.

## Core Concepts

### Character Entity
Each character is defined by:
- **Identity**: Name, type (player/NPC), and story role (major/minor/wildcard/background)
- **Personality**: Traits, core beliefs, goals, and fears that drive behavior
- **Status**: Life state (alive, deceased, missing, ascended) with timeline tracking
- **Affiliations**: Connections to factions and locations (home vs current)
- **Relationships**: Sentiment-based connections to other characters
- **History**: Story beats witnessed, reputation tags, and historical events

## The Character <> World Story Interaction

Characters have a deep, bidirectional relationship with the world story, providing both context and reacting to narrative developments.

### 1. How Characters Provide Context to the World Story

Characters enrich the narrative by providing a rich cast of personalities and relationships for the AI to draw upon.

- **Character Seeding**: Characters can be automatically generated when factions are created or when specific story beats require new personalities. The `generateNPCsForBeat` procedure creates contextually appropriate characters.
- **World Event Generation**: Character actions and status changes are primary sources of `world.event.logged` events. Deaths, resurrections, faction changes, and major relationship shifts all contribute to the narrative pool.
- **Relationship Networks**: The web of character relationships provides social context for story generation. A character's death has different narrative weight depending on their connections.
- **Location Population**: Characters populate locations, making them feel alive. The system tracks both home and current locations, enabling displacement and migration narratives.

### 2. How Characters React to the World Story

Characters are designed to respond dynamically to the evolving narrative through several mechanisms.

- **Beat Reaction System**: The `CharacterService` subscribes to `world.beat.created` events. When new story beats are generated, characters can be automatically relocated, have their status changed, or form new relationships based on the narrative content.
- **Personality Evolution**: Characters' goals and beliefs can evolve based on witnessed events. The AI analyzes recent experiences and updates personality traits through the `updatePersonality` system.
- **Automatic NPC Generation**: When story beats introduce new scenarios, the system can automatically spawn appropriate NPCs using the `generateNPCsForBeat` functionality, ensuring the cast stays relevant to the narrative.
- **Faction Integration**: Characters react to faction status changes through the `changeFaction` system, creating realistic political upheaval scenarios.

## AI Integration

The Character AI adapter is responsible for:

### Character Generation
- **Faction Characters**: Creating thematically appropriate characters for specific factions with proper ideological alignment
- **Beat Characters**: Generating NPCs relevant to specific story developments
- **Relationship Networks**: Establishing logical connections between newly created characters

### Character Evolution
- **Goal Updates**: Analyzing character experiences to suggest new objectives and abandon outdated ones
- **Personality Evolution**: Adjusting traits and beliefs based on significant experiences
- **Relationship Evaluation**: Suggesting relationship changes based on story events

### Character Enrichment
- **Background Development**: Expanding character backstories with rich detail
- **Appearance/Voice**: Adding physical and vocal descriptions
- **Historical Context**: Connecting characters to world events and faction history

## Technical Architecture

### Service Layer
The `CharacterService` orchestrates all character operations:
- **Event Subscriptions**: Listens for world events, faction changes, and location updates
- **Lifecycle Management**: Handles creation, updates, relationships, and death
- **AI Coordination**: Delegates generation and evolution tasks to the AI adapter

### Repository Pattern
The `ICharacterRepository` interface abstracts data persistence:
- **Character CRUD**: Standard create, read, update, delete operations
- **Relationship Management**: Separate relation creation and management
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient lookups by world, faction, location, and status

### Event System
Characters emit structured events for system integration:
- **Character Created**: New character added to world
- **Character Moved**: Location changes for population tracking
- **Character Died**: Death events with impact assessment
- **Relationship Formed**: New social connections established

## Integration Points

### World Module
- Subscribes to beat creation events
- Emits world events based on character actions
- Provides world context for character generation

### Faction Module
- Characters belong to factions and react to faction changes
- Faction status affects member characters
- Character actions influence faction power and reputation

### Location Module
- Characters populate locations and can relocate
- Location status changes affect resident characters
- Migration patterns emerge from location desirability

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed queries by world, faction, location, and status
- Efficient relationship lookups through dedicated junction table
- Array fields for tags and goals enable flexible querying

### AI Usage
- Batch character generation for efficiency
- Caching of personality evolution prompts
- Selective enrichment based on character importance

### Event Processing
- Asynchronous event handling to prevent blocking
- Batch processing of multiple character updates
- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

## Future Enhancements

Planned architectural improvements include:

- **Skill System**: Quantified abilities and progression tracking
- **Inventory Management**: Items and possessions with ownership transfer
- **Health/Status Tracking**: Physical and mental condition monitoring
- **Dialogue System**: Persistent conversation history and response patterns
- **Character Templates**: Archetypal starting points for rapid character creation
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Automated relationship evolution based on proximity and shared experiences
