# Narrative Design Guide

This guide explains how the World Story Engine creates compelling narratives and how game designers can leverage the system for dynamic storytelling.

## The Save the Cat Structure for Worlds

The engine adapts Blake Snyder's Save the Cat screenplay structure for world-building. Instead of following a character's journey, we track an entire world's transformation.

### The 15-Beat World Arc Structure

#### Act 1: Equilibrium (Beats 0-4)
1. **Status Quo** (Beat 0) *[Anchor Point]*
   - The world in its current state
   - Existing tensions and power structures
   - Seeds of change already present

2. **Rising Tensions** (Beat 1)
   - First signs of instability
   - Competing interests emerge
   - Players begin to choose sides

3. **First Tremors** (Beat 2)
   - Initial conflicts or discoveries
   - Old systems show cracks
   - New possibilities glimpsed

4. **The Catalyst** (Beat 3)
   - Major event that disrupts equilibrium
   - Cannot be ignored or reversed
   - Forces world to respond

5. **Shock Waves** (Beat 4)
   - Immediate consequences ripple out
   - Different regions react differently
   - Players scramble to adapt

#### Act 2: Chaos (Beats 5-10)

   - Chaos spreads
   - Opportunities and dangers multiply

7. **Power Vacuum** (Beat 6)
   - Leadership contested
   - New factions emerge
   - Alliances shift rapidly

8. **The Turning Point** (Beat 7) *[Anchor Point]*

    - Climactic confrontation
    - All forces engaged
    - World's fate in balance

13. **The Synthesis** (Beat 12)
    - New order established
    - Lessons integrated
    - Transformation complete

14. **New Dawn** (Beat 13)
    - World in new equilibrium
    - Changed but stable
    - New normal established

15. **Future Seeds** (Beat 14) *[Anchor Point]*
    - Hints of next cycle
    - Unresolved tensions
    - Setup for future arcs

## Sparse Generation Strategy

The system only pre-generates three anchor points:
- **Opening State** (Beat 0): Where we begin
- **Turning Point** (Beat 7): The pivotal change
- **Final State** (Beat 14): Where we end up

This allows maximum flexibility for player influence while maintaining narrative direction.

## Writing Effective World Arcs

### 1. Focus on Systems, Not Individuals
- Think about how societies, economies, and environments change
- Individual heroes emerge from player actions
- World changes affect everyone

### 2. Create Meaningful Stakes
- Changes should matter to players
- Economic, territorial, magical, or technological shifts
- Both opportunities and threats

### 3. Enable Player Agency
- Multiple ways to engage with each beat
- Different factions to support
- Varied strategies for success

### 4. Build on History
- Reference previous arcs
- Show consequences of past events
- Create sense of living history

## Example Arc Concepts

### "The Great Awakening"
- **Opening**: Ancient magical artifacts discovered
- **Turning Point**: Magic returns to the world
- **Final State**: New magical age with transformed society

### "The Sundering"
- **Opening**: Territorial disputes escalate
- **Turning Point**: Catastrophic war breaks reality
- **Final State**: Fractured world with isolated realms

### "The Convergence"
- **Opening**: Parallel dimensions detected
- **Turning Point**: Barriers between worlds collapse
- **Final State**: Merged multiverse with new rules

## Integrating Player Actions

### Event Impact Levels
- **Minor**: Local changes, individual achievements
- **Moderate**: Regional effects, guild actions
- **Major**: World-changing discoveries, mass movements
- **Catastrophic**: Reality-altering events

### Narrative Responsiveness
The AI incorporates recent events when generating beats:
1. Reviews last 5-10 major events
2. Identifies patterns in player behavior
3. Weaves consequences into next beat
4. Creates opportunities based on player interests

## Best Practices

### 1. Seed Compelling Conflicts
- Economic vs. environmental interests
- Technology vs. tradition
- Order vs. freedom
- Known vs. unknown

### 2. Create Rich Factions
- Clear motivations
- Distinct advantages/disadvantages
- Reasons for players to care
- Dynamic relationships

### 3. Design Flexible Objectives
- Multiple paths to success
- Partial victories possible
- Failure creates new opportunities
- Player creativity rewarded

### 4. Maintain Tonal Consistency
- Establish world's genre and stick to it
- Build on established lore
- Respect player investment
- Evolution, not revolution

## Debugging Narratives

When narratives feel off:
1. Check event incorporation
2. Verify anchor point alignment
3. Review faction motivations
4. Ensure player agency preserved
5. Validate tonal consistency

## Advanced Techniques

### Parallel Narratives
Run multiple arcs in different regions:
- Creates richer world
- Allows specialized gameplay
- Increases player options
- Enables epic convergences

### Nested Arcs
Smaller stories within larger ones:
- Personal stakes within world events
- Guild dramas during wars
- Local mysteries amid chaos

### Reactive Factions
AI-driven faction responses:
- Analyze player allegiances
- Adjust faction strategies
- Create dynamic opposition
- Reward clever politics
